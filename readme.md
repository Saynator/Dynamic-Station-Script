# DYNAMIC STATION SCRIPTS #

## Idea ##

The dynamic station scripts (DSS) is a script pack which spreads over multiple programmable blocks who can communicate with each other through commands.
The advantages of this are:

- The Script has no character limit as modifications and complex scripts are spread out through multiple programmable blocks
- Allows the user to select which scripts they actually want to use, saving performance.
